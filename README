To get faceSwapper working you need to include OpenCV Java libraries, as per http://docs.opencv.org/2.4.6/doc/tutorials/introduction/desktop_java/java_dev_intro.html

That means compiling OpenCV with all the necessary dependencies, adding a .jar to the project and placing a .so in a directory reachable by the app.
